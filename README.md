# Ea-G-Chat(Easy Chat)(Ea-Gopi-Chat)
Hello guys!
This is one of my best application I have made.
It is simply a Chat application.In which we can chat with any persons we want.
In simple words we can say that it is a mini What'sapp.
I had Integrated this application with the Firebase.
                                                    
                                               The main Key features in this application are:
                                                        1.Email- Verification.
                                                        2.User Authentiaction.
                                                        3.Login Screen.
                                                        4.Signup Screen.
                                                        5.Chat Screen.
                                                        6.Logout from the account.
                                                        7.Remove the Account.
                                                        8.Change Password.
                                                        9.Forget Password.
                                                        
Now let me explain breifly about these features.

Email-Verification: In this if new user filled the signup form with valid details then he will get the verification link through e-mail.So that if clicked on that link then
                    his/her account is created and added to Firebase Database.Otherewise, he won't be able to sign-in to his account.
                    And there is one more interesting fact that the user need to verify his e-mail in 20 minutes only.Otherwise, the verification link is expired and the user
                    needs to Sign-up again.

User Authentication: In this field it requires the user e-mail,password. If he enters his/her credentials correctly then he would be able to use his/her account.
                     the activity of the user wil be added to the firebase.

Login Screen: In this screen,consists of few fields.They are User E-mail,User password,Forget password,Sign-in Button.

SignUp Screen: In this Screen, consists of few fields. They are User name,User E-mail,password,Re-type Password,Sign-up Button.

Chat Screen:In this screen, We can make a chat with any person we like.

Logout from the account: Actually it is a list item, If we clicked on this list item then we logged-out from our account.

Remove the account: Actually it is a list item, If we clicked on this list item then our account is removed from the Database.

Change Password: Actually it is a list item, If we clicked on this list item then we are able to change the password of our account.For this we will get a email with link.
                 if we click on that link then we can change the password.
                 
Forget Password: It is present in Login Screen, Some times we may forget our password, then at that times if we click on this text then we can change the password our
                 account with recieving some link through e-mail.
                 
                 
                 
                 
                 
                              If u want to use my application then you need to integrate it with the firebase in your Android Studio.
                                                           Otherwise it will throw some errors.
