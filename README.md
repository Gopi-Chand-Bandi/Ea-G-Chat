Hello guys!
This is one of my best application I have made.
It is simply a Chat application.In which we can chat with any persons we want.
In simple words we can say that it is a mini What'sapp.
I had Integrated this application with the Firebase.
                                                    
                                               The main Key features in this application are:
                                                        1.Email- Verification.
                                                        2.User Authentiaction.
                                                        3.Login Screen.
                                                        4.Signup Screen.
                                                        5.Chat Screen.
                                                        6.Logout from the account.
                                                        7.Remove the Account.
                                                        8.Change Password.
                                                        9.Forget Password.
                                                        
Now let me explain breifly about these features.

**Email-Verification:** In this if new user filled the signup form with valid details then he will get the verification link through e-mail.So that if clicked on that                         link then his/her account is created and added to Firebase Database.Otherewise, he won't be able to sign-in to his account.
                    And there is one more interesting fact that the user need to verify his e-mail in 20 minutes only.Otherwise, the verification link is expired and                       the user needs to Sign-up again.

**User Authentication :** In this field it requires the user e-mail,password. If he enters his/her credentials correctly then he would be able to use his/her account.
                          the activity of the user wil be added to the firebase.

                              If u want to use my application then you need to integrate it with the firebase in your Android Studio.
                                                           Otherwise it will throw some errors.
